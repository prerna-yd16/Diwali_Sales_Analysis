PYTHON SALES ANALYSIS

This project utilizes Python and its libraries namely NUMPY, SEABORN, MATLPLOTLIB, and PANDAS, for EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS.

Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

1. Data Collection
Data collection is an essential part of exploratory data analysis. It refers to the process of finding and loading data into our system. Good, reliable data can be found on various public sites or bought from private organizations. Some reliable sites for data collection are Kaggle, Github, Machine Learning Repository, etc

3. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning refers to the process of removing unwanted variables and values from your dataset and getting rid of any irregularities in it. Such anomalies can disproportionately skew the data and hence adversely affect the results. Some steps that can be done to clean data are:

Removing missing values, outliers, and unnecessary rows/ columns.
Re-indexing and reformatting our data.

3. Univariate Analysis
In Univariate Analysis, you analyze data from just one variable. A variable in your dataset refers to a single feature/ column. You can do this either with graphical or non-graphical means by finding specific mathematical values in the data. Some visual methods include:

Histograms: Bar plots in which the frequency of data is represented with rectangle bars.
Box plots: Here the information is represented in the form of boxes.
Let's make a histogram out of our SalePrice column.  

4. Bivariate Analysis
Here, you use two variables and compare them. This way, you can find how one feature affects the other. It is done with scatter plots, which plot individual data points or correlation matrices that plot the correlation in hues. You can also use boxplots.

Then Reaching conclusions, such as in our case we analyzed the sales reports and derived the conclusion for it.
